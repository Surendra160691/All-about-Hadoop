1. MovieLens data => extract year from the title
2. How to move data from DB to HDFS/HIVE/HBASE/Hadoop?
3. What is HBASE?
4. 

What to Gather? How to develop a Project?
1. DataSets, like MovieLens, Olympic
2. Problem Statement, 


Your friend told you that he is working on logs? [can i duplicate that?]
1. import logs to hdfs
2. analysis => how many are in online/chat/duration (online activity)
3. 

We need to process the log? Not fixing the log.

JOIN Explanation:
----------------
setA and setB => setA JOIN setB => one keyword can help you solve the issue

MapReduce => JAVA => Program => Algorithm => JOIN

JOIN => internally has 3 algorithms => SORT(10+ways) + COMPARE + MERGE
	
	SORT => we avoid unneccessary iterationsj
	
	setA: anil,
			sunil,
				avil
	setB: anil,
			surendra,
				siva

How to make use of MR for JOIN?
	=> which operation hadoop is doing autimagically => sort and shuffle


Programmer: PAIN area => LOGIC
input => HDFS 

DB => SQOOP => HDFS
DB => JAVA => HDFS

Hadoop, HDFS, MR, HIVE, PIG, SQOOP, HBASE, FLUME, IMPALA, OOZIE, Zookeeper, Scala, Spark, Hue, Kafka, 

"pick 3/4 skill which will give you job" => HDFS/MR/HIVE/PIG => Job Skills

PreRequisite => JAVA/LINUX/SQL

60% of the extra tools => not supposed to suck your time => 10% time is itself more to it.

How to process an XML file?

Normal Data:
	excel
	pdf
	csv
	txt
	xml
	json
	
Big Data FileFormats: (Data + MetaData + Binary + KeyValue)
	Sequence Files
	Parquet Files
	ProtoBuffs
	Avro Files
	RC files
	ORC files
	etc
	
1. MovieLens question?
	1234, Titanic (1997), romance => 3 fields => based on comma delimiter(seperator of fields + 1 delimiter for a file) 
		what happens if I use "(" as delimiter
			=> 
			USING PigStorage(',')
				WHERE 
				FILTER
				
				extract year => how to do? "String functions" => string manipulations
				
				GROUP => field with name group, use AS to get alias

				
				',' OR '(' OR ')'

hi',' OR '(' OR ')'hello',' OR '(' OR ')'how',' OR '(' OR ')'are',' OR '(' OR ')'you

Home Work:
----------
1. Use all String Manipulation Functions in PIG. Create Questions accordingly.
